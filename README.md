# I. *****Introduction*****

NYC is an incredibly dense city - people, buildings, cars, buses, trains, construction, energy consumption - the congestion in the city is quite intense and has developed a hazardous amount of pollution and smog across the city. The air in NYC, especially over Manhattan, can sometimes be visible as a foggy layer of smog from other boroughs. On a daily basis the temperature and PM concentration is recorded. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is also recorded, via a 24 hour average of hourly pm concentration. The air contains fine patriculate matter that can be measured as PM 2.5 and PM 10 that are many times smaller than human hair and make up calculable concentrations of pollution. This fine PM can be hazardous to human health and may also add to global warming effects within the city. 
    
    
# II. *****Exploratory Questions*****

    Im curious to explore the following:
    
    - PM concentrations across NYC Boroughs
    - PM producers across NYC
    - PM concentration changes over time
    - Temperature averages over time
    - Elevation of PM cpncentrations
    
    
# III. *****Hypothesis*****
    
    Im curious to confirm whether or not temperature affects the PM count. I believe that when it is hotter, the PM count will be greater. I do believe with hotter air the particles will rise, but I'm also curious about cold temperatures potentially making the air more dense, which in turn may affect the pm concentration and AQI. 
    
    
# IV. *****Method*****
    
    - I would like to gather daily data over NYC to plot the records alongside eachother and identify any relationships
    
    - I intend to collect this data from publicly available datasets within the EPA, NYC Gov, and NOAA
    
    - I will need temperature data to plot
    - I need to gather PM concentrations and plot them alongside temperature
    - Lastly I will need to sourcec AQI data to plot with the temperature and pm datasets
    - I plan to use Python programming to organize the datasets. From there I can make calculations and visualize the data thorugh plots and tables.
