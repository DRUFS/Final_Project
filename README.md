# I. *****Introduction*****

    NYC is an incredibly dense city - people, buildings, cars, buses, trains, construction, energy consumption - the congestion in the city is quite intense and has developed a hazardous amount of pollution and smog across the city. The air in NYC, especially over Manhattan, can sometimes be visible as a foggy layer of smog from other boroughs. The air contains fine patriculate matter that can be measured as PM 2.5 and PM 10 that are many times smaller than human hair and make up calculable concentrations of pollution. This fine PM can be hazardous to human health and may also add to global warming effects within the city.  
    
    
# II. *****Exploratory Questions*****

    Im curious to explore the following:
    
    - PM concentrations across NYC Boroughs
    - PM producers across NYC
    - PM concentration changes over time
    - Temperature averages over time
    - Elevation of PM cpncentrations
    
# III. *****Hypothesis*****
    
    Im curious to confirm whether or not temperature affects the PM count. I believe that when it is hotter, the PM count will be greater. I do believe with hotter air the particles will rise, but I'm also curious whether or not due to the density of vertical construction if the PM is trapped, remaining at lower elevations closer to the human population to breathe in.  
    
    
# IV. *****Method*****
    
    - I want to confirm the effects of global warming and what the data is for NYC, temperature wise, over time. I will gather temperature data for this
    
    - I need to gather PM concentrations over time and gather that data as well
    
    - I intend to gather this data from publicly available sources from the EPA, NYC Gov, and Purple Air
    
    - I plan to use Python programming to organize and calculate data sets in order to calculate tables as evidence and plot the data
